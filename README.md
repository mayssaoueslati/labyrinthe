# Pathfinding Game with Pygame

## Overview

This is a simple pathfinding game built using Python's Pygame library. The game allows the player to navigate a grid-based map, attempting to reach a designated endpoint while avoiding obstacles. The player can move using arrow keys, and the game tracks player health, which decreases if the player tries to move to an invalid location.

## Features

- Randomly generated graph representing nodes and arcs (connections)
- Player movement across a grid using arrow keys
- Visual representation of paths, walls, and the player's position
- Health system for the player
- Game-winning and losing conditions

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pathfinding-game.git
   cd pathfinding-game
Usage
Run the game:

bash
python main.py
Controls:

Use the arrow keys to move the player (red square).
The objective is to reach the green square (end point) while navigating through the grid.
If you attempt to move to an invalid location, your health decreases.
The game displays health status and instructions at the bottom of the screen.
Game End Conditions:

You win if you reach the endpoint.
You lose if your health reaches zero.
