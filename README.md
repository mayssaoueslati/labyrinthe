elcome to the Labyrinth Game! This is a maze-solving game where players navigate through a grid-based labyrinth, avoiding obstacles and finding the exit. The goal is to reach the finish line as quickly as possible.

Project Overview
This repository contains the source code for a browser-based labyrinth game built with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. Players can use arrow keys or touch gestures to move through the maze. The game can be expanded with multiple levels, different maze sizes, and scoring mechanics.

Key Features:
Maze Generation: The game dynamically generates a random maze for each playthrough.
Player Navigation: The player can use keyboard arrows or touch controls to move.
Obstacles: The maze contains walls and obstacles that the player must navigate around.
Exit Point: The player’s goal is to reach the exit point of the maze.
Customizable Difficulty: You can adjust the size of the maze or add time limits to make the game more challenging.
Tech Stack
The Labyrinth Game is built using:

Frontend:
HTML5: For the basic structure of the game and the canvas element to display the maze.
CSS3: For styling the maze and player.
JavaScript: For game logic, including maze generation, player movement, and interactions.
Game Mechanics
1. Player Controls:
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move through the maze.
On mobile devices, swipe gestures can be implemented to move the player.
2. Maze Generation:
The maze is randomly generated each time you start the game, offering a different challenge in each playthrough.
3. Win Condition:
The player wins by reaching the designated exit point of the maze.
4. Obstacles and Walls:
The player cannot move through walls. They must navigate around them to find a path to the exit.
